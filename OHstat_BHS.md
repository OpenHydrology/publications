NB each sentence on a separate line makes life a lot easier for differences.


## Para 1: Introduction

The *Flood Estimation Handbook* (Institute of Hydrology, 1999) together with subsequent updates represents best practice for flood estimation in the UK (Environment Agency, 2012).
The guidance, which built on the *Flood Studies Report* (Institute of Hydrology, 1975), provides a broad range of robust methods for rainfall-runoff modelling and statistical flood flow assessments.
To implement the guidance hydrologists have relied on ad-hoc in house spreadsheets and commercial software that have struggled to kept pace with current scientific literature.
Open Hydrology (OH) provides a rapid means for academics to freely disseminate their innovations with practitioners in industry.
By adopting a free open source model OH encourages the sharing of ideas, a test bed for the latest scientific methods and the continued improvement of the user experience.


## Para 2: What?

The OH project is a collection of like-minded academics and consultants that are collaborating to develop new and innovative open source software for hydrologists.
OH plan to develop a comprehensive range of hydrological programmes that cover the latest published guidance on hydrological modelling and statistical analysis.
To date, OH has already released the *floodestimation* python library which provides a python implementation of the very latest statistical flood estimation methods including enhanced single sites and transferring locally gauged data.
The *floodestimation* library has been packaged into *Auto Statistical* to automatically create client ready flood frequency reports by simply right clicking on a catchment descriptor file.
The team is currently working on a graphical user interface to assist use of the *floodestimation* library when assessing more complex sites.
The team has plans to develop rainfall-runoff, low flow analysis and hydraulic modelling software.
