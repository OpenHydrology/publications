## Para 1: Introduction

The *Flood Estimation Handbook* (Institute of Hydrology, 1999) together with subsequent updates represents best practice for flood estimation in the UK (Environment Agency, 2012).
The guidance, which built on the *Flood Studies Report* (Institute of Hydrology, 1975), provides a broad range of robust methods for rainfall-runoff modelling and statistical flood flow assessments.
To implement the guidance hydrologists have relied on ad-hoc in house spreadsheets and commercial software that have struggled to kept pace with current scientific literature.
Open Hydrology (OH) provides a rapid means for academics to freely disseminate their innovations with practitioners in industry.
By adopting a free open source model OH encourages the sharing of ideas, a test bed for the latest scientific methods and the continued improvement of the user experience.
