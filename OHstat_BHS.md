# Open Hydrology launches open-source flood estimation software


## Para 1: Introduction

The *Flood Estimation Handbook* (Institute of Hydrology, 1999) together with subsequent updates represents best practice for flood estimation in the UK (Environment Agency, 2012).
The guidance, which is built on the *Flood Studies Report* (Institute of Hydrology, 1975), provides a broad range of robust methods for rainfall-runoff modelling and statistical flood flow assessments.
To implement the guidance hydrologists have relied on ad-hoc in house spreadsheets and commercial software that have struggled to keep pace with current scientific literature.
Many professional hydrologists report that neither approach has provided the  modern software they need to innovate or work efficiently.
The recently founded Open Hydrology (OH) project provides a rapid means for developers and academics to freely distribute their work to practitioners.
By adopting an open source model OH encourages the sharing of ideas, a test bed for the latest scientific methods and the continued improvement of the user experience.


## Para 2: What?

The OH project is a collection of like-minded academics and consultants that are collaborating to develop new and innovative open source software for hydrologists.
It is hoped that through OH that one day a comprehensive range of open source hydrological programmes that cover the latest published guidance on hydrological modelling and statistical analysis will be made available.
To date developers have already released the *floodestimation* python library via OH.  The library provides a python implementation of the very latest statistical flood estimation methods including pooled analysis, enhanced single sites and transferring local gauged data.
The *floodestimation* library has been packaged into *Auto Statistical* to automatically create frequency reports by simply right clicking on a catchment descriptor file, making the process of generating a default flood frequency curve a matter of seconds rather than minutes and without the hassle of a software licence charge.
The *floodestimation* library also seamlessly manages downloading the latest *HiFlows* dataset and allows the manual editing or addition of flow records.
Currently developers are working on a graphical user interface to assist use of the *floodestimation* library when assessing more complex sites.
The contributors a broad range of development plans including rainfall-runoff, low flow analysis and hydraulic modelling software, however beauty of the OH project is that it provides a means for hydrologists to become developers and create the software they need to solve the challenges they face.

## Para 3: Using

So why do the OH contributors choose to give away their work as open source software?
Well, for the same reason as those behind very successful open source software like Mozilla Firefox, OpenOffice, Linux, GIMP and QGIS, to meet the specific needs of the developers.
So it really is software for hydrologists, developed by hydrologists.
This software development model provides a sustainable framework for the continued development of software.
In return developers are able to promote their technical capabilities, provide commercial training and software technical support services, and provide additional services to their clients.



## Para 4: What next?

To be a real success OH needs more hydrologists to get involved in the development, testing and use of the software.
It does not matter if you are not a developer as there is help needed to simply demonstrate the reliability and usability of the existing software through it being used on a day to day basis.
The best way to find out more is by going to the the OH website [open-hydrology.org] where you can find links to the latest software releases, the project's LinkedIn, Wiki and *GitHub* repository.
